This projeect was given as asn assignment by my professor. In this project, I have done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Analysis on the italy province dataset which was taken from kaggle.
# EDA
- performed necessary operations using pandas on the dataframe.
- visualizations done using plotly.
- checked for ANOVA conditions and performed ANOVA test.
# Time Series Analysis
- checked for any trends, irregularity, seasonality on the dataset.
- used ARIMA model to perform time series analysis (since the data is not seasonal).

The datset is attched.
