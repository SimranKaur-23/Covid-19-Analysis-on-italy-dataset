# Covid-19-Analysis-on-italy-dataset
This project was given as asn assignment by my professor. In this project, I have done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Analysis on the italy province dataset which was taken from kaggle.
## EDA
- performed necessary operations using pandas on the dataframe.
- visualizations done using plotly.
- checked for ANOVA conditions and performed ANOVA test.
## Time Series Analysis
- checked for any trends, irregularity, seasonality on the dataset.
- used ARIMA model to perform time series analysis (since the data is not seasonal).
## LSTM
The LSTM file is attched seperately as LSTM.ipynb

The datset is attached.
